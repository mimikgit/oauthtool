## Getting Started
Simply clone down this reposity, install dependencies, and get started on your application.

The use of the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is **strongly** recommended, as opposed to using `npm`.

# install dependencies
yarn
```

# Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode
yarn dev

# `yarn compile` & create build with electron-builder
yarn buil
